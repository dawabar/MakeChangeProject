## Make Change Project

### Week 1 Homework for Skill Distillery

## Overview

**Cash register simulator.**

This project is intended to take an item cost as an input, an amount tendered (up to $20) as an input, and then calculate the correct amount of each denomination of change to be returned to the customer ($10, $5, $1, 25c, 10c, 5c, 1c).

This is a simple console-based input application designed to test concepts learned during week one of the Skill Distillery bootcamp.

Topics covered in Week 1:

* System configuration (Eclipse, Atom, Git, GitHub, Terminal, Slack)
* Variables & Constants
* Methods
* Capturing keyboard inputs to the console
* Expressions
* If-Else
* While & Do-While
* Switch-Case
* For Loops
* Numeral systems, data types, & casting
* Pair Programming
 

## Technologies/Skills Used

* Java
* Eclipse
* Git
* GitHub
* Markdown (for README.md)
* Slack
* Zoom
* Browser (Chrome-focused)
* Unix/Linux Terminal

## Lessons Learned

* ==**Clean code is not easy.**==  It takes a lot of experience to learn to write effective code that is easily readable by other coders.
* The old lines from [the Hacker FAQ by Pete Seebach](https://www.seebs.net/faqs/hacker.html) absolutely hold true.  ==It's important to walk away from the code and percolate on the problem.==  ***I found myself dreaming in algorithms all this week, waking to solutions to problems that were challenging a day or two earlier.***
>2.0: My hacker plays video games on company time.
>    Hackers, writers, and painters all need some amount of time to spend "percolating" -- doing something else to let their subconscious work on a problem. Your hacker is probably stuck on something difficult. Don't worry about it. 
>2.1: But it's been two weeks since I saw anything!
>    Your hacker is working, alone probably, on a big project, and just started, right? She's probably trying to figure it all out in advance. Ask her how it's going; if she starts a lot of sentences, but interrupts them all with "no, wait..." or "drat, that won't work", it's going well. 
>2.2: Isn't this damaging to productivity?
>    No. Your hacker needs to recreate and think about things in many ways. He will be more productive with this recreation than without it. Your hacker enjoys working; don't worry about things getting done reasonably well and quickly.
* ==**Dealing with floating-point numbers in Java is painful.**== Refactoring my code to deal with the math using only integers, and then formatting it back into a decimal form, was far more effective than dealing with the imprecision of floating-point arithmetic in Java.  I know there are many built-in methods in Java libraries that deal with these problems, but we haven't learned them yet, and I'm trying to work with the tools I've been given.  **To be fair, performing math on integers and converting them into floating-point numbers is how Java works at the machine level anyway.**
* ==**The Skill Distillery program is effective.**== While I find myself mostly re-learning things I've learned from self-taught Python and VBA, the foundation is laid very deliberately throughout this course.  Each new lesson builds on previous information, ensuring that no major facet of computer programming is missed.  I am hoping that the coming 13 weeks are equally additive and progressive in their approach.
* ==**Comments and documentation are important.**== But, as the old saying goes, "No one writes the MAN pages."  Still, the program's efforts to encourage documentation (including this README doc) are helpful for organizing thoughts and building deliberate knowledge.
* ==**My practice at algorithms over the last two decades makes learning code much easier.**== Because I've been studying different algorithms and techniques for the last two decades, it's easier to conceptualize solutions than if this was all new for the first time.  While I'm starting to learn true programming techniques late in life, my programming-adjacent exposure and personal desire to learn math (mostly math history) has really helped in creating effective solutions to problems, which opens the door to focus on user experience within my code, no matter how rudimentary it is right now.
